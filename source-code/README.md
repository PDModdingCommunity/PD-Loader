## Installation

* Have a **full clean** game version **"7.10"** decompressed without any modifications.

* Decompress everything into the **root folder** of the game.

* Install the official **"mdata"**.
**M215** to **M271** are supported, custom ones are also supported.

To install them you have to drop each **"mdata"** update decompressed into the **"mdata\"** folder in the root folder of the game (create it if it doesn't exists).

**e.g.** For all the official **"mdata"** you should have the following folders inside:
  * M215
  * M220
  * M230
  * M240
  * M250
  * M260
  * M270
  * M271

Files required to make **"mdata"** available in the game are included (**"ram\databank\PvList*"** files).

## Usage

**IMPORTANT:** Do *not* edit any of the *.ini* configuration files with Notepad. Use [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download) (or WordPad) with UTF-8 encoding instead, otherwise your game may crash.

Use **"plugins\components.ini"** to enable or disable TLAC components.
Use **"plugins\config.ini"** to enable or disable plugins loading along other useful settings.
Use **"plugins\keyconfig.ini"** to change your game keybinds.
Use **"plugins\playerdata.ini"** to change your playername and other player customization.

Place any **.dva** plugin you want to use inside the **"plugins"** folder.

Launch **"diva.exe"**.
Use **"--launch"** argument to bypass the launcher and to be able to use other arguments.

## Modules

Edit **"plugins\playerdata.ini** with [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download) (or WordPad) and set use_card to true.

## FAQ

Only **NVIDIA** videocards are supported for now, AMD and Intel GPU support is possible but further research needs to be done. On computers with multiple GPUs, such as most laptops, the game must be set to run on the NVIDIA GPU manually.

**Linux** can run the game with **Wine**, for audio you must use [DivaSound](https://github.com/somewhatlurker/DivaSound).
WMV movie videos are not supported and it is recommended to set **No_Movies** to **1** to prevent crashes when the game attempts to load a movie.

**Windows 7** is supported except for WMV movie videos.

Previous versions used **dinput8.dll** in the game root folder, if you still have it you must delete it.

Always use the original game executable.
